# Resources

I'll be adding resources here throughout the semester.

## Textbooks

### [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin
A tried-and-true standard textbook for computational linguistics and NLP. The book's website includes slides too, which are great for a quick reference. Accompanying Youtube lectures can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaZQkZp6WhWyvdiP49JG-rjyTPck_hvEu).

### [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf) by Jacob Eisenstein
A high quality, detailed, and somewhat technical introduction to NLP.

## Articles

### [Inside the Matrix](https://pytorch.org/blog/inside-the-matrix/)

### [Interactive Gradient Descent](https://blog.skz.dev/gradient-descent)

### [The Animated Transformer](https://prvnsmpth.github.io/animated-transformer/)

### [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/)

### [A walk through latent space with Stable Diffusion](https://keras.io/examples/generative/random_walks_with_stable_diffusion/)

## Videos

### [What is a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=1)
A brilliant visual introduction to deep learning by 3blue1brown (Grant Sanderson). See also his interactive courses on [neural networks](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks), [linear algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra), and [calculus](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus).



## Full Courses

### [CS124: From Languages to Information](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaZQkZp6WhWyvdiP49JG-rjyTPck_hvEu)
A Stanford NLP course by Dan Jurafsky, based on the textbook *Speech and Language Processing* linked above. More accessible than the other courses listed below.

### [CS224N: NLP with Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSH4v6133s9LFPRHjEmbmJ)
A Stanford course by Christopher Manning, free on Youtube. This is aimed at Computer Science majors, so it may be more accessible after you have already learned the basics in this course.

### [CS 198-126: Modern Computer Vision Fall 2022](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzWRmD0Vi2KVsrCqA4VnztE4t71KnTnP5) (UC Berkeley Course Playlist)
A UC Berkeley course on computer vision, free on Youtube. Quite technical, and best approached after this class.
